An integer is said to be prime if it is divisible by only 1 and itself. For example, 2, 3, 5 and 7 are prime, but 4, 6, 8 and 9are not.  a) Write a function that determines
whether a number is prime.  b) Use this function in a program that determines and prints all the prime numbers between 1 and 10,000. How many ofthese 10,000 numbers do you
really have to test before being sure that you have found all the primes?

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
int isPrime(int);
int main()
{
    cout<<"The prime numbers between 1 to 10,000 : ";
    for (int i=2;i<=10000;i++)
    {
        if (isPrime(i))
        {
            cout<<i<<"\t";
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

int isPrime(int num)
{
    int count =0;
    for (int i=1;i<=num;i++)
    {
        if(num%i==0)
        {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    if (count==2)
    {
        return 1;
    }
    else
    {
        return 0;
    }
}
