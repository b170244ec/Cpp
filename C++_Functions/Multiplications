Computers are playing an increasing role in education. Write a program that will help an elementary school student learn multiplication. Use rand to produce two positive 
one-digit integers. It should then type a question such as: How much is 6 times 7?. The student then types the answer. Your program checks the student's answer. 
If it is correct, print "Very good!", and then ask another multiplication question. If the answer is wrong, print "No. Please try again." and then 
let the student try the same question again repeatedly until the student finally gets it right. 



#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
void multiplication(void);
int main()
{
    srand(time(0));
    multiplication();
    return 0;
}
void multiplication(void)
{
    int x,y,response=0;
    cout<<"Enter -1 to end: \n";
    while(response !=-1)
    {
        x = rand()%10;
        y = rand()%10;
        cout<<"How much is "<<x<<"times "<<y<<"(-1 to end): "<<endl;
        cin>>response;
        while(response !=-1 && response != x*y)
        {
            cout<<"No. Please try again.\n ?"<<endl;
            cin>>response;
        }
        if (response!=-1)
        {
            cout<<"Very Good: \n\n";
        }
    }
    cout<<"That's all for now. Bye"<<endl;
}
