The use of computers in education is referred to as computer-assisted instruction (CAI). One problem that develops in CAI environments is student fatigue. This can be
eliminated by varying the computer's dialogue to hold the student's attention. Modify the program of Exercise 3.35 so the various comments are printed for each correct answer
and each incorrect answer as follows:
Responses to a correct answer
Very good!
Excellent!
Nice work!
Keep up the good work!
Responses to an incorrect answer
No. Please try again.
Wrong. Try once more.
Don't give up!
No. Keep trying.
Use the random number generator to choose a number from 1 to 4 to select an appropriate response to each answer. Use a switch
structure to issue the responses.
